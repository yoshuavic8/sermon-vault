# Walking by Faith, Not by Sight

## Introduction

_"For we walk by faith, not by sight."_ - 2 Corinthians 5:7

What does it mean to walk by faith in a world that demands proof? Today we'll explore how faith is not the absence of questions, but the presence of trust.

---

## I. Understanding Faith (Hebrews 11:1)

**Faith is:**

- The substance of things hoped for
- The evidence of things not seen
- Not blind belief, but confident trust

### Key Points:

1. Faith is foundational to Christian life
2. Faith comes by hearing God's Word (Romans 10:17)
3. Faith requires action, not just acknowledgment

**Illustration:** Abraham leaving Ur without knowing the destination

---

## II. The Challenge of Walking by Faith

### Common Obstacles:

- Demanding tangible proof
- Trusting our own understanding (Proverbs 3:5-6)
- Fear of the unknown
- Past disappointments

**Question for reflection:** Where in your life are you demanding sight instead of exercising faith?

---

## III. Practical Steps to Grow Faith

### 1. **Immerse in God's Word**

_"Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God"_ (Romans 10:17)

### 2. **Remember Past Faithfulness**

- Keep a "faith journal"
- Recall God's provision
- Share testimonies

### 3. **Take Small Steps of Obedience**

- Faith grows with exercise
- Start where you are
- Don't wait for perfect conditions

### 4. **Surround Yourself with Faith-Filled Community**

- Iron sharpens iron
- Encourage one another
- Learn from spiritual mentors

---

## IV. The Reward of Faith

**What we gain:**

- Peace in uncertainty
- Direction in confusion
- Strength in weakness
- God's pleasure (Hebrews 11:6)

**Hebrews 11 - Faith Hall of Fame:**

- Abel offered by faith
- Noah prepared by faith
- Abraham obeyed by faith
- Moses chose by faith

## Conclusion

Faith is not:

- ❌ Pretending everything is okay
- ❌ Denying reality
- ❌ Refusing to ask questions

Faith is:

- ✅ Trusting God despite circumstances
- ✅ Acting on God's promises
- ✅ Walking forward when you can't see the path

---

## Application Questions

1. What area of your life requires a step of faith right now?
2. How can you practically trust God more this week?
3. Who in your life needs to hear about God's faithfulness?

---

## Prayer Points

- For courage to walk by faith
- For trust when circumstances are unclear
- For testimonies of God's faithfulness
- For others struggling with doubt

## Personal Notes

Preparation began January 27. Spent extra time on Hebrew word study for "faith" (אֱמוּנָה - emunah).

Recent conversation with Sarah (church member facing job uncertainty) inspired practical applications section.

Consider developing this into a 4-week series on faith.
